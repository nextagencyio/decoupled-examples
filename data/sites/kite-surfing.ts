Kitesurfing is its own unique discipline and we teach everything from scratch. That said, experience with surfing, wakeboarding, or snowboarding can help with balance and board feel.</p>' },

If you can swim comfortably and have moderate fitness, you can learn to kite. Our instructors teach efficient body mechanics so you do not need to muscle through anything.</p>' },
