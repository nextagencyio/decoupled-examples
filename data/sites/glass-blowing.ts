We provide all necessary protective equipment.</p>' },

        { id: 'glass-faq-3', question: 'When can I pick up my piece?', answer: '<p>Glass must cool slowly in an annealer over 12 to 24 hours to prevent cracking. Pieces are typically ready for pickup the day after your session. We will email you when they are ready.</p>' },
